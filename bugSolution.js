The solution involved a combination of clearing the cache and reinstalling dependencies.  First, I deleted the `node_modules` folder, ran `npm cache clean --force`, then ran `npm install` again.  In addition to the standard cache clearing and dependency reinstallation steps, it was also necessary to clear the Android build cache and rebuild the project's Gradle files. This ensures that no corrupted or stale build artifacts interfere with the subsequent build process.  For a more thorough solution, reinstall expo globally.  Then, after that is complete, retry the steps above.
