# Expo CLI Android Build Error: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI during Android builds, resulting in a cryptic error message: "Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0". The issue appears after a recent update to the Expo CLI and only affects Android builds. iOS builds remain unaffected.

## Bug Reproduction

1.  Ensure you have the latest version of Expo CLI installed.
2.  Attempt to build an Android version of your Expo app using `expo build:android`.
3.  Observe the build failure and error message.

## Solution

The root cause was identified as a corrupted or incomplete dependency within the project's package.json file.  The provided solution focuses on cleaning up build files and reinstalling dependencies.  In addition to the cleaning and reinstalling, you may need to check the integrity of the expo package itself and even reinstall it globally using "npm install -g expo-cli" or yarn global add expo-cli".

## Additional Notes

This bug seems to be linked to a recent Expo CLI update.  The vague error message made debugging challenging, necessitating a careful investigation of the project's configuration and build process.
