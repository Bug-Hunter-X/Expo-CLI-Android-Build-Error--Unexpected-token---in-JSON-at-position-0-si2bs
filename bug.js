While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process. The error message was vague, and I couldn't find any relevant solutions online.  The error occurred after a recent update to Expo CLI and only impacted builds for Android. iOS builds were unaffected. The build process would initiate, but then abruptly halt with the message: "Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0".  No further details were provided.
